          <h4>What's the goal of these visualizations?</h4>
          We are trying to understand which industries are impacted most by COVID-19. To do that, we must look at the percent increases in unemployment from before the pandemic to after the preliminary impacts are evident. Therefore, we utilize February (the final month where the U.S. economy was stable) and April (the month where industries saw the highest unemployment rates). After identifying specific industries with the greatest – and least – percent increases in unemployment, we will be able to analyze their gender and racial makeups and investigate whether COVID-19 is likely to affect certain groups more severely than others? <i>(Note that some industries are not included in this study due to lack of sufficient unemployment rate or employee data.)</i>

          The industries highlighted in red represent those with the highest unemployment rate increases, and similarly, the industries highlighted in green represent those with the lowest unemployment rate increases. Now, let's take the most critically-impacted industries and see what happened to their unemployment rates at a more granular level.

          <h4>Let's isolate the COVID-19 region.</h4>
          We can examine the top three affected industries and see how they fare from February to June in terms of unemployment rate. In February, before the economic downfall, rates are normal, close to what they have been for the last several years. In March, we observe a slight incline, hinting that something bigger is approaching. As COVID-19 takes its first nationwide toll, we see unemployment rates in April drastically spike to about four times greater than they were the former month. Reflecting unemployment benefits, government policies, and the race to open up jobs and businesses once again in the midst of a pandemic, May and June indicate lower unemployment rates. Because COVID-19 is the the only possible major propagator for this turn of events, we can conclude that it alone inflicted this serious economic damage from which we will likely struggle to recover.

          <h2>The Wage Gap</h2>
          The <i>wage gap</i> pervades societies in America and around the world. It results from several factors, including gender, race and ethnicity, disability, access to education, and age.

          <p></p>

          <div class='row'>

            <div class='col-lg-6'>
              <h4>What is the wage gap?</h4>
              On average, women and minorities earn less than men in every single occupation for which there is sufficient data provided. In 2018, women made only 82 cents to every dollar made by men (a gender wage gap of 18%). For minorities and women of color specifically, the wage gap is even wider. Since the Equal Pay Act was signed in 1963, the wage gap has been closing at an exceedingly slow rate. <i>(Note: Asians and other races are not included in this study due to lack of sufficient wage gap data.)</i>
            </div>

            <div class='col-lg-6'>
              <h4>How is it calculated?</h4>
              The wage gap for women is calculated by adding the annual salaries of women who work full-time, and finding the median salary. The pay gap is commonly reported as a percentage and compares the difference between figures for men and women. A similar process is used when calculating the wage gap for minority groups. 
            </div>

          </div>

          <p></p>

          <div class='row'>

            <div class='col-lg-6'>
              <h4>Why does it exist?</h4>
              A large reason for the wage gap for women and minorities is attributed to discrimination in hiring and pay descions. They are constantly overlooked by employers who tend to favor white males. Moreover, women and minority-dominated industries tend to attract lower wages. Social pressure and bias often discourage members of these demographics from pursuing higher-paid, male-dominaated careers.
            </div>

            <div class='col-lg-6'>
              <h4>How does COVID-19 come into play?</h4>
              As a result of the economic shutdown and ensuing quarantine, many industries have been suffering. In particular, research shows that unemployment rates are rising faster for women and people of color. These demographics are overrepresented in industries that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, and are often at the top of company layoff lists.

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>

          Explain the (possible) correlations between industries facing the greatest unemployment rates and the wages of those industries. Connect these wages to the gender/race representations per industry and gender/race-specific hourly wages. For example, "leisure and hospitality," the industry that has sufferred the most economically due to COVID-19, also has a very low average wage of ____ (one of the lowest). From the % representation pie chart shown above, we see that this industry has a higher proportion of blacks, and this group has an average hourly wage of ____, whereas whites have a significantly higher hourly wage. Therefore, job losses will hurt this group more than others. Potential future work ideas: use wage gap data that breaks down minority races by gender as well.
