          <h2>COVID-19: A World Evolving</h2>
          In a perfect world, economic impact studies would be conducted only to analyze the effects of positive events: expansion of a local manufacturer, increase in education attainment, or a reduction in the poverty rate are a few examples. Unfortunately, sometimes negative events must also be identified and measured; one such event is the current COVID-19.

          <h4>What is COVID-19?</h4>
          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that originated in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the world because of human interaction, travel, and physical contact. It is a newly discovered coronavirus, which is a large group of diseases that can infect both animals and humans. Check out the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" style='color: blue'><u>World Health Organization</u></a> page and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html" style='color: blue'><u>CDC's list of FAQs</u></a> for more information on this pandemic.

          <h4>How has it impacted us, and what does this study aim to do?</h4>
          On May 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic, and since then, it has continued to wreak havoc around the world. Since the early months of 2020, the U.S. has seen more than its fair share of economic downturns. This study combines two perspectives – unemployment rates and wage gaps – to understand if certain industries and people could be more vulnerable to its effects than others, in addition to what these insights can say about Americans. While the full extent of the pandemic is still yet to be seen, many communities, businesses, and governments are scrambling to assess the economic damage. Like them, we can conduct our own study.
