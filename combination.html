          <h2>Combining Two Economic Ideas</h2>
          Unemployment and the wage gap are closely related, as one may expedite the other. For example, if a certain industry, race, or gender faces a higher unemployment rate increase due to the pandemic, the wage gap there is likely to increase as a result. On the scatter plot to the right, each dot corresponds to its respective color in the table, where it represents the relationship between percent increase in unemployment (shown on a <a href='unemployment.html' style='color: blue'><u>previous page</u></a>) and average hourly wage of the industry in June 2020.

          <p></p>

          <i>Note: when retrieving average hourly wages, data for nonsupervisory employees was taken to avoid skews due to outliers.</i>

          It's very interesting to note that the scatter plot above seems to display a downward trend. As percent increase in unemployment rises, average hourly industry page drops. There is definitely correlation between the two factors. <b>In other words, industries with greater unemployment incrases are the same industries with lower pay; the lower end of wages appears to be disproportionally impacted.</b>

          <p></p>

          With this hypothesis, we can plot unemployment rates by gender and race over the last few years to understand how much COVID-19 has affected them.

          <p></p>

          <div class="card mb-3">

                  </div>
              </div>

          Plotting unemployment rates is the first step, but we must conduct a percent increase test to determine which group truly faced the greatest unemployment increases. The bar graph below depicts these calculations for each race and gender.

          <p></p>

          <div class="card mb-3">

                </div>
              </div>

          Unemployment rates of men and women have been extremely similar (and even overlap with one another) throughout the last several years. <b>However, as supported in the bar graph, women faced a higher unemployment increase than their counterparts during this time.</b> This was very close to the increase rate of Hispanics, followed by whites, men, and finally, blacks.

          <h3>At-Risk Industries and Racial/Gender Demographics</h3>
          Because we have isolated the most impacted industries, we can now make predictions about which races or genders are most at risk of unemployment by looking at the percent racial and gender makeups of these industries. These industries are highlighted in red in the table and scatter plot at the beginning of this page. The goal is to discover, can we find any patterns.

          <h3>Link to the Wage Gap</h3>
          To connect our unemployment findings to the wage gap, we can investigate the average hourly wages of all genders and races. We can also use numerical stats of average hourly wages, b/c people of color usually get lower pay.

          From the bar graphs above, we see that men earn much more than women per hour, and the same holds for whites earning more than their respective minorities. The higher the pay of the industry, the less chance of unemployment, and the greater the wage gap, because the dominant race/gender will increase their money at a faster rate. We know unemployment can push people further back and exacerbate the wage gap even further. https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110216.htm

          <h2>COVID-19 Impact Conclusions</h2>

          The <i>New York Times</i> describes that we can estimate economic impact using two factors: wage and percent representation, where lower wages and greater minority representation may correlate with the level of negative economic impact caused by COVID-19. With this statement, we can see that 

          Explain the (possible) correlations between industries facing the greatest unemployment rates and the wages of those industries. Connect these wages to the gender/race representations per industry and gender/race-specific hourly wages. For example, "leisure and hospitality," the industry that has sufferred the most economically due to COVID-19, also has a very low average wage of ____ (one of the lowest). From the % representation pie chart shown above, we see that this industry has a higher proportion of blacks, and this group has an average hourly wage of ____, whereas whites have a significantly higher hourly wage. Therefore, job losses will hurt this group more than others. Potential future work ideas: use wage gap data that breaks down minority races by gender as well.
